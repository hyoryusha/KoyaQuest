## About Mt. Kōya
Located in the mountains of Wakayama Prefecture, Japan, Mt. Kōya (高野山) is home to one of Japan's oldest and most important Buddhist monastic centers. It was founded by a scholar-priest named Kūkai (空海) in the early ninth century. Included on UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites, it is a popular destination for tourists and religious pilgrims alike.

## Background
This app and its contents grew out of a Scavenger Hunt game that I made for my students during annual field trips to Mt. Kōya. It is my first app. (Though there are good things to be said about a baptism by fire, I probably should have started with something less complicated.)
