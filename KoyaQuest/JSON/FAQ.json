In 804, he traveled to China where he was initiated into the secret teachings of Esoteric Buddhism. Two years later he returned to Japan to establish the Shingon School, the center of which is the monastic complex of Mt. Kōya.\nIn addition to his religious teachings, Kūkai was also an educator who founded the earliest schools for the education of the general public. He was an accomplished calligrapher, engineer and linguist. He is credited by some as the inventor of the Japanese phonetic alphabet (kana).\nIn 845, at the age of 62, Kūkai was enshrined in the mausoleum of Oku-no-in. The faithful beleive that he did not die but that he entered into a state of perpetual meditation."
