They have since been adopted by the Japanese into the Japanese Buddhist pantheon and now stand at the entrance to many temples to ward off the enemies of the faith.\nThe mouth of the guardian on the right is open to represent the sound \"ah\" and he is accordingly called Agyō. Ungyō, his companion on the left, has his mouth closed as he pronounces the sound \"hum.\"  Together these two syllables create the sound \"aum,\" which is the Sanskrit word for absolute truth or ultimate reality."

Like the Kongō rikishi who guard the temple gates, they are depicted with open and closed mouths as they voice the sacred syllables that represent Dainichi Nyorai in the Diamond and Womb Realms of esoteric Buddhism."

Typically, the center of the pagoda symbolizes the absolute truth at the center of the universe. Here, at Mt. Kōya that space is occupied by the Great Sun Buddha, the embodiment of that truth.\nThe Konpon Daitō is an example of a tahōtō, or \"pagoda of myriad treasures,\" which is distinctive of Shingon, or Esoteric, Buddhist architecture. The tower built here at Mt. Kōya under Kūkai’s instructions is the first such tower in Japan. The two-tier structure and its incorporation of circular and spherical forms is reminiscent of Indian stupa design (and perhaps why it is sometimes called the \"Great Stupa\").

Originally, known as the Kōdō, or “Lecture Hall,” it remains the setting for most of the important religious services held throughout the year at Mt. Kōya. The term “Golden Hall,” which it shares with the main halls of other early Buddhist temples (Nara’s Hōryūji and Tōshōdaiji temples, for example), is thought to stem from either the gilt used as part of the interior ornamentation or perhaps the golden color of the Buddhist image venerated within.\nThe central object of worship inside the Golden Hall of Mt. Kōya is Ashuku Nyorai (Skt: Akshobhya) whose image is located behind the closed doors of a black cabinet behind the central dais. In Esoteric Buddhism, this Buddha is identified with Yakushi Nyorai (Skt: Bhaisajyaguru), the Buddha of Medicine and Healing. While his image is hidden (revealed only once, during the celebrations of 1,200th-anniversary of the founding of Mt. Kōya), we can see six companion deities in the bays to the left and right. They are Kokūzō Bosatsu, Gōzanze Myō’ō, and Kongō-ō; and Kongōsatta, Fudō Myō’ō, and Fugen Bosatsu, respectively.\nFacing each other from the left and right sides of the large central area (known as the naijin) are the two mandala central to Shingon Buddhist faith and practice. On the left (or western) side is the Diamond Realm Mandala; on the right (or eastern) side is the Womb Realm Mandala. The latter is sometimes called the “Blood Mandala” in reference to a legend in which Taira no Kiyomori (1118 – 1181) is said to have used blood from his own forehead to color part of the diadem of the Great Sun Buddha.\nThe actual mandala are housed at the nearby Reihō-kan Museum as smoke from incense used at the Kondō was judged to be harmful to these important treasures.",

The previous Golden Hall burned to the ground in a fire in the early hours of December 26, 1926, between memorial services for the Taishō Emperor Yoshihito, who had died the day before.\nDespite frantic efforts to save them, most of the precious objects inside the Kondō were reduced to ashes. The sculptures used to replace the lost images of Ashuku and his six companions were carved by the artist Takamura Kōun (1865 – 1934) who was 75 years old when he began the five-year project to complete the new statues. Each day he worked, Takamura underwent ritual purification and maintained a strict fast. While the centerpiece of his work is hidden from view, we can certainly admire the religious piety and devotion of the artist."

Kōya, is from the second half of the 14th century.\nAmong its unique features are the different styles with which its four corners were designed, a consequence of having been constructed by four different builders. Also, unlike most temples, Fudōdō has more of a residential appearance.\nWhile believed to have originally housed the Buddha Amida Nyorai (Amitābha), it was later dedicated to and named for Acala, the Immovable Wisdom King. Fudō Myō'ō, as he is known in Japanese, is a fierce, warrior-like deity highly revered in Shingon as a manifestation of Dainichi Nyorai. Despite his rather frightening appearance, he is popular among the faithful for his determination to protect Buddhism from its enemies.\nStatues of Fudō Myō'ō as well as his eight attendants, which were once housed in this hall, are national treasures and are prominently displayed in a special room at the nearby Reihōkan Museum. The figures of the eight attendants are the work of the master sculptor Unkei (d. 1223).",

Where is Daqin? What faith is meant by the “Luminous Religion”? And, finally, why is there a full-sized copy of this monument here at Mt. Kōya?\nA clue to the answers appears just above its name, where we can clearly see a Christian cross within the triangular space between the two dragons. Alopen, as is known from this monument and this monument alone, seems to have been the first Christian missionary to China. He is believed to have been of Syrian origin and a member of the Church of the East, a branch of Christianity which is sometimes identified with the Nestorians. The place name Daqin, mentioned in the name of the stele, was used by the Chinese to refer variously to either the Roman or Byzantine empires.\nThe original monument, which was re-discovered in 1625 after having been buried for more than seven centuries, is a testament to the recognition of Christianity by the second emperor of the Tang Dynasty.",

It was one of her beliefs that Buddhism and Christianity were fundamentally related. The “Stele of the Luminous Religion” was proof that Christianity was known in Chang’an at the time that Kūkai lived there.  Since it is likely that he would have been aware of Christianity, the development of Kūkai’s religious thought and the doctrine of “True Speech” (i.e. \"Shingon\") may have been influenced by its teachings.\nUnder Gordon’s patronage, this replica was created and placed at Oku-no-in in 1911. This was still a few years before women were allowed on the mountain, so Mrs. Gordon was not there to see its dedication. Her ashes, however, are buried nearby."

Also known as Kishin Shōnin, Jōyō is credited with having helped rebuild Mt. Kōya after a series of catastophic fires. A second lamp was donated by retired emperor Shirakawa (1053-1129) in the year 1103. \nAccording to a popular legend, the third lamp was the gift of a poor maiden who sold her hair to a wig maker in order to make the donation on behalf of her adoptive parents. The filial young woman's name was Oteru (which means \"to shine\") and her lamp is called the Hinnyo-no-ittō, or \"The Poor Woman's Solitary Lamp.\" \nThe legend tells us that when her modest donation received the mockery and contempt of a rich man who had made a more extravagant donation, a strong gust of wind immediately arose from the direction of the Inner Sanctuary. It blew out all of the wealthy man's lamps leaving Oteru's untouched."
